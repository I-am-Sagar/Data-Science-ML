Classification of Data Analytics:
1. Descriptive Analytics: Conventional Form of BI & DA. It tries to provide the summary view of data in understandable format. It is describing - "What happened?". Examples: Company reports that provide a historic view.
2. Diagnostic Analytics: Form of advanced analytics which examines data and tries to answer - "Why did it happen?". This allows to dig deeper into an issue and we can study more about, say, source of the issue. In a structured business environment, tools for both descriptive and diagnostic analysis go parallel. It uses the techniques such as: Data discovery, Data mining, Correlations, etc. 
3. Predictive Analytics: This tries to forecast trends based on current events. This tries to answer - "What will happen?". Predicting the probability of the event happening or time at which the event will happen, is what is studied in this type of analysis. <br> Step 1: Historical Data + Predictive Algorithms = Models <br> Step 2: New Data + Models = Predictions.
4. Prescriptive Analytics: This is the set of techniques that indicate the best course of action. It tells what decisions to make to optimize the outcome. The goal is to enable: quality improvements, service enhancements, cost reductions & increased productivity. The examples of this type of analysis are: optimization models, simulations, decision analysis, etc. 

Classification of Data:

Data
* Categorical
* Numerical
    - Discrete
    - Continuous

Levels of measurement of data:

* Nominal - Lowest level of measurement: Classifies data into distinct categories in which no ranking is implied. Eg. Gender, Marital Status, etc. 
* Ordinal: Classifies into categories in which ranking is implied. Eg. Product Satisfaction (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied), Student Grades (A, B, C), Rank (Lead, Associate, Assistant), etc.
* Interval: Ordered scale in which difference between measurements is a meaningful quantity but the measurements do not have a true zero point. Eg. Temperature, Year, etc.
* Ratio - Highest level of measurement: Ordered scale in which difference between measurements is a meaningful quantity and have a true zero point. Eg. Weight, Age, Salary, etc.

Visual Representation of Data: 

* Histogram: Vertical bar chart of frequencies. 
* Frequency Polygon: Line graph of frequencies. 
* Ogive Curve: Line graph of cumulative frequencies. 
* Pie Chart: Proportional representation for categories of a whole.
* Stem & Leaf Plot
* Pareto Chart
* Scatter Plot
* Heatmap
* Pictograms
* Box Plots

Measures of Central Tendency: A single number to describe the characteristics of a set of data.

* Mean
    - Arithmetic
    - Weighted
* Median
* Mode
* Percentile

Measures of Variability/Dispersion:

* Skewness
    - Data is symmetrical: Mean = Median = Mode
    - Data is right-skewed (Positively skewed, the peak is on the left hand side): Mode < Median < Mean 
    - Data is left-skewed (Negatively skewed, the peak is on the right hand side): Mean < Median < Mode

    S, coefficient of skewness = 3(µ - M)/σ

* Kurtosis
* Range
* Interquartile Range
* Variance
* Standard (Z) Score
* Coefficient of variation

Empirical Rule for mean & standard deviation: Assumption is data is normally distributed

* µ ± σ => 68% coverage
* µ ± 2σ => 95% coverage
* µ ± 3σ => 99.7% coverage

Sampling: 

* For sample & population, formula of standard deviation & variance is different.
