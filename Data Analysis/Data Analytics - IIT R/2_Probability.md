Methods of finding probability:
* Classical method (rules & laws): number of outcomes in favor/total outcomes possible. Each outcome is equally likely. Determined apriori - i.e. before the experiment is conducted. Applicable to games of chance. 
* Relative frequency of occurence (cumulated historic data): number of times favorable event occured/total number of trials. Computed after the experiement. Useful where repeating the same experiment in a simulation is not a big deal but finding the laws that govern the probability is tough.
* Subjective probability (intuition or domain expertise): Comes from person's intuition & reasoning. Everyone will come up with their own value. Useful for the unique and single-trial experiments: new product introduction, initial public offering of a common stock, site selection decision, sporting events. 

Probability Terminology:

* Experiment
* Trial
* Event
* Sample Space
* Unions & Intersections
* Mutually exclusive Events
* Independent Events
* Completely Exhaustive Events
* Complementary Events

Counting rules:
* AND and OR principles
* Principle of inclusion exclusion
* Permutations & Combinations

Types of probabilities:
* Marginal: The probability of X occurring
* Union: The probability of X or Y occurring
* Joint: The probability of X and Y occurring
* Conditional: The probability of X occurring given Y has already occurred

Bayes' Rule

Probability Distribution: 
* Describes the shape of a batch of numbers
* The characteristics of a distribution can be sometimes defined using a small number of numeric descriptors called parameters.
* Distribution can:
    - serve as a basis for standardised comparison of empirical distributions
    - can help us estimate confidence intervals for inferential statistics
    - forms the basis for more advanced statistical methods

Random Variables
* It is a variable that contains the outcome of a chance experiment.
* Discrete or Continuous

Expected Value & Variance of X
* Meaning
* Properties of Expected Value
* Properties of Variance

Covariance

Correlation

Special Distributions
* Discrete
    - Binomial
    - Poisson
    - Hyper Geometric
* Continuous
    - Uniform
    - Exponential 
    - Normal
