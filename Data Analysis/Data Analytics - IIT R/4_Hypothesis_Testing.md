Hypothesis Testing:
* Used to determine whether a statement about the value of population parameter should or should not be rejected. 
* The null hypothesis is a tentative assumption about the population parameter
* The alternate hypothesis is the opposite of what is stated in the null hypothesis
* Correct hypothesis formulation takes practice!
* Many applications of hypothesis testing involve an attempt to gather evidence in support of a research hypothesis. In such cases, it is often best to begin with the alternate hypothesis and make it the conclusion that the researcher hopes to support. The conclusion that the research hypothesis is true is made if the sample data provide sufficient evidence to show that the null hypothesis can be rejected. 
* Null hypothesis is an assumption to be challenged. 
* The equality part of the hypotheses always appears in the null hypothesis. 

Concept of Tails
* One-tailed
    - Left
    - Right
* Two-tailed

Type 1 and Type 2 errors
* False positives & false negatives. They have inverse relationship. Reduce one, other is increased. Which one to reduce? Depends on the cost of the errors. 

My Addition:
* You mostly try to reduce Type 2 error (False Negatives). That's why the hypothesis you try to prove correct is alternate and then you try to challenge Null.
* If you do the reverse, ie. try to support Null and reject alternate, then you are reducing Type 1 error (False positives). 

Why this way?
* In the tests, we compared the p-value to a controlled probability of a Type 1 error, α, which is called the level of significance for the test. 
* With a significance test, we control the probability of making the Type 1 error, but not the Type 2 error. 
* We recommend the conclusion, "do not reject Ho" rather than "accept Ho" because the latter puts us at risk of making a Type 2 error. 
* With the conclusion "do not reject Ho", the statistical evidence is considered inconclusive. 
* Usually, this is an indication to postpone a decision until further research and testing is undertaken. 
* In many decision-making situations, the decision maker may want in some cases may be forced to take the action with oth the conclusions: "do not reject Ho" and "reject Ho". 
* In such situations, it is recommended that the hypothesis testing procedure be extended to include the consideration of making a Type 2 error. 

Steps of Hypothesis Testing: p-value approach
1. Develop the null and alternate hypotheses
2. Specify the level of significance, α.
3. Collect the sample data and compute the test statistic (z-value, t-value, etc.)
4. Use the value of the test statistic to compute the p-value. 
5. Reject null hypothesis, if p value is less or equal to α.

Steps of Hypothesis Testing: Critical Value approach
1. Develop the null and alternate hypotheses
2. Specify the level of significance, α.
3. Collect the sample data and compute the test statistic (z-value, t-value, etc.)
4. Use the level of significance to determine the critical value and the rejection rule.
5. Use the value of the test statistic and the rejection rule to determine whether to reject null hypothesis.

* Population Proportion
* Population Variance

Same Hypothesis Testing for 2 samples now:
* Population Mean
* Population Proportion
* Population Variance

Power Curve:
* The probability of correctly reject Ho when it is false is called the power of the test. 
* For any particular value of m, the power is 1 - beta. 
* We can show graphically, the power associated with each value of mu, such a graph is called 'power curve'.
